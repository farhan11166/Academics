Question 2) â€“ In Question 2, I/O running immediately is used, that is, first I/O is collected, then CPU is used unlike the first process. But there would not be any change compared to the first, as CPU is never empty for the first 7 seconds because either PID 0 occupies it or PID 1 occupies it. After that, we are just reshuffling the order of CPU and I/O processes for PID 2, hence no time change.
